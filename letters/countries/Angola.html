    <h1>Here are some interesting facts about Angola</h1>
    <h2>Did you know:</h2>
    <p>Angola, country located in southwestern Africa. <br>
        A large country, Angola takes in a broad variety of landscapes, <br>
        including the semidesert Atlantic littoral bordering Namibia’s <br>
        “Skeleton Coast,” the sparsely populated rainforest interior, <br>
        the rugged highlands of the south, the Cabinda exclave in the north, <br>
        and the densely settled towns and cities of the northern coast and north-central river valleys. <br>
        The capital and commercial centre is Luanda, a large port city on the <br>
        northern coast that blends Portuguese-style colonial landmarks with <br>
        traditional African housing styles and modern industrial complexes.</p>
    <p>It has a population of 36,684,202</p>
